-- =========================================================
-- Climate Conference Analysis
-- Data source: conference_db (vips, reservations, hotels, events)
-- Author: Your Name Here
-- Description:
--   Analysis of VIP participation at a climate research conference.
--   Demonstrates LEFT JOIN, INNER JOIN, multiple JOINs, SELF JOIN,
--   and a subquery, plus use of BIT (0/1) RSVP flags.
-- =========================================================


-- =========================================================
-- TABLE REFERENCE (from project instructions)
-- ---------------------------------------------------------
-- vips(member_id, last_name, first_name, event, provides_feedback_to,
--      association, assoc_type, member_since)
--
-- reservations(member_id, hotel, welcome_rsvp, dinner_rsvp)
--   - welcome_rsvp, dinner_rsvp are BIT/boolean style:
--       1 = yes / attending
--       0 = no / not attending
--
-- hotels(hotel_id, hotel_name, address)
--
-- events(event_id, event_name, event_type)
-- =========================================================



-- =========================================================
-- 1. [LEFT JOIN]
-- Question:
--   List every VIP and, if they are presenting, show the event name and type.
--   This helps see who is attached to an event and who is not.
-- Technique:
--   LEFT JOIN so that VIPs without an event still appear in the results.
-- =========================================================

SELECT 
    v.member_id,
    v.first_name,
    v.last_name,
    e.event_name,
    e.event_type
FROM vips AS v
LEFT JOIN events AS e
    ON v.event = e.event_id
ORDER BY 
    v.last_name,
    v.first_name;



-- =========================================================
-- 2. [INNER JOIN]
-- Question:
--   Which VIPs have any reservation on file (hotel + RSVP info)?
--   This answers: who is fully set up in the reservations system.
-- Technique:
--   INNER JOIN between vips and reservations to keep only VIPs
--   that appear in both tables.
-- =========================================================

SELECT 
    v.member_id,
    v.first_name,
    v.last_name,
    r.hotel,
    r.welcome_rsvp,
    r.dinner_rsvp
FROM vips AS v
INNER JOIN reservations AS r
    ON v.member_id = r.member_id
ORDER BY 
    v.last_name,
    v.first_name;



-- =========================================================
-- 3. [MULTIPLE JOINS]
-- Question:
--   For each VIP with a reservation, which hotel are they staying at
--   and what are the hotel details?
--   This gives the event team a quick view of VIP distribution by hotel.
-- Technique:
--   vips  -> reservations  -> hotels
--   (JOIN + JOIN) to pull VIP names, RSVP info, and hotel details.
-- =========================================================

SELECT 
    v.member_id,
    v.first_name,
    v.last_name,
    h.hotel_name,
    h.address,
    r.welcome_rsvp,
    r.dinner_rsvp
FROM vips AS v
JOIN reservations AS r
    ON v.member_id = r.member_id
JOIN hotels AS h
    ON r.hotel = h.hotel_id
ORDER BY 
    h.hotel_name,
    v.last_name,
    v.first_name;



-- =========================================================
-- 4. [SELF JOIN]
-- Question:
--   Who is giving feedback to whom?
--   Each VIP is assigned to provide feedback to another VIP.
--   This is useful to verify feedback assignments and relationships.
-- Technique:
--   SELF JOIN on vips:
--     - "reviewer" is the VIP giving feedback
--     - "reviewed" is the VIP receiving feedback
-- =========================================================

SELECT 
    reviewer.member_id        AS reviewer_id,
    reviewer.first_name       AS reviewer_first_name,
    reviewer.last_name        AS reviewer_last_name,
    reviewed.member_id        AS reviewed_id,
    reviewed.first_name       AS reviewed_first_name,
    reviewed.last_name        AS reviewed_last_name
FROM vips AS reviewer
JOIN vips AS reviewed
    ON reviewer.provides_feedback_to = reviewed.member_id
ORDER BY 
    reviewer.last_name,
    reviewed.last_name;



-- =========================================================
-- 5. [YOUR CHOICE #1 – BIT COLUMNS / RSVP BEHAVIOR]
-- Question:
--   Which VIPs said "YES" to BOTH the welcome party and the thank-you dinner?
--   This identifies highly engaged attendees that are present at all social events.
-- Technique:
--   Filter on BIT-style columns:
--     welcome_rsvp = 1 AND dinner_rsvp = 1
--   Also join hotels so we can see where these highly engaged VIPs are staying.
-- =========================================================

SELECT 
    v.member_id,
    v.first_name,
    v.last_name,
    h.hotel_name
FROM vips AS v
JOIN reservations AS r
    ON v.member_id = r.member_id
LEFT JOIN hotels AS h
    ON r.hotel = h.hotel_id
WHERE r.welcome_rsvp = 1
  AND r.dinner_rsvp = 1
ORDER BY 
    v.last_name,
    v.first_name;



-- =========================================================
-- 6. [YOUR CHOICE #2 – SUBQUERY]
-- Question:
--   Which VIPs are presenting at the most common type of event?
--   (For example, if panels are the most common event type, this returns
--    all VIPs presenting on panels.)
-- Technique:
--   Step 1: In a subquery, find the event_type with the highest count
--           of VIPs.
--   Step 2: Use that event_type in the outer query to list all VIPs
--           presenting at that type of event.
-- =========================================================

SELECT 
    v.member_id,
    v.first_name,
    v.last_name,
    e.event_name,
    e.event_type
FROM vips AS v
JOIN events AS e
    ON v.event = e.event_id
WHERE e.event_type = (
    SELECT 
        e2.event_type
    FROM vips AS v2
    JOIN events AS e2
        ON v2.event = e2.event_id
    GROUP BY 
        e2.event_type
    ORDER BY 
        COUNT(*) DESC
    LIMIT 1
)
ORDER BY 
    v.last_name,
    v.first_name;
